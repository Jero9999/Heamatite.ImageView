Image viewer in WPF

Ok, so I am a web dev by profession. Wanting to branch out, or maybe just expand my skillset a little.The Image viewer project is my first real project using XAML so it's most likely a little rough around the edges. But that's what it's for. it's a learning tool.

It's inspired by my personal want for a simple image viewer. ACDSee used to be that. But now it has turned into bloatware (IMHO). 
All I really want is the ability to view an archive of images. There are other simple tools out there that will do that but importantly one of my requirements is that it will be able to view the contents of zip files (and potentially other archive types too)

So there you go.
